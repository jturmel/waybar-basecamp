            ## Quick Install (Recommended)

            To install the **latest** version of `waybar-basecamp`:
            ```bash
            curl -sL https://github.com/jturmel/waybar-basecamp/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
            ```

            To install **this specific version** (${{ github.ref_name }}):
            ```bash
            curl -sL https://github.com/jturmel/waybar-basecamp/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/install.sh | VERSION=${{ github.ref_name }} bash
            ```

            The script will automatically download the binary and set up the systemd services for you.

            ### Final Step
            After installation, don't forget to follow the [Waybar Integration](https://github.com/jturmel/waybar-basecamp#waybar-integration) steps in the README to update your Waybar configuration and see your notifications!
